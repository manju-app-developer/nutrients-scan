        <h1>Privacy Policy for Nutri Scan</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated: October 04, 2025</strong></p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.</p>

        <h2>Interpretation and Definitions</h2>
        <p>...</p> <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Nutri Scan is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect personally identifiable information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Image Data:</strong> When you use our service to analyze a food item, the image you capture is sent to a secure backend service for processing by an AI model. This image is used solely for the purpose of identifying the food and is not stored or logged on our servers after the analysis is complete.</li>
            <li><strong>Scan History:</strong> To provide the "Scan History" feature, the results of your analysis (food names and portion sizes) are stored locally in your web browser's storage. This data is never transmitted to our servers and remains exclusively on your device. Clearing your browser's cache or using the "Clear History" button will permanently delete this data.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We may use third-party services like Google Analytics to collect anonymous usage data to help us improve the service. This may include information like your device type, browser, and general location (e.g., country). This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally.</li>
        </ul>
